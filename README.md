# TechFun
## By KodingKing

I have been working on TechFun for a while now, and it is about time that it gets released!
Note: This is not a copy of Slimefun, it is just my version that I have custom coded, however I have taken some inspiration from Slimefun's Guide and Multiblocks.

## What does it do?
TechFun turns your default Bukkit server into a full on modpack with just one simple plugin!

Bugs
If you find a bug then you can report it here! Be sure to describe the way that you did the bug and what the result is!

Credits
