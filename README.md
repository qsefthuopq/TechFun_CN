# TechFun
## By KodingKing

I have been working on TechFun for a while now, and it is about time that it gets released!
Note: This is not a copy of Slimefun, it is just my version that I have custom coded, however I have taken some inspiration from Slimefun's Guide and Multiblocks.

## What does it do?
TechFun turns your default Bukkit server into a full on modpack with just one simple plugin!

## Working on the source
Run Build Tools anywhere on your computer. More instructions on doing this can be found [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/).

Open up an Intellij maven project from the source code using the git option and if asked enable auto import. Create a new maven run configuration and name it 'Build'. Insert into the command line options 'clean package'. When you are ready to build your project into a Spigot jar then run this configuration.

That should be all you need to work on the source of TechFun! If an update to the source code was made whilst you were working on it then just pull the changes and continue working.

## Bugs
If you find a bug then you can report it here! Be sure to describe the way that you did the bug and what the result is!
